## üì¶ Compile

### üì§ Dependencies
You need to go to download the [`nlohmann/json releases GitHub page`](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases) and download the `json.hpp`. Then copy the `json.hpp` where the `blue_dragon.cpp` file is.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run

If you are in a linux environment you can run:

```bash
# Run either
./build.sh
# or manually run
g++ -pthread -std=c++17 -O3 -o webserver blue_dragon.cpp
```

Then you can go to [http://localhost:8080/public/index.html](http://localhost:8080/public/index.html) and you will see something like this:

## üß™ Testing

### üå°Ô∏è Load Testing

We are gonna use [`locust`](https://locust.io/) to test out our endpoints
and measure how well the server manage threads.

To install the dependencies just run:

```bash
pip install locust
```

And to run our *tests* go the `testing` folder and run:

```bash
# Run either
./loadtesting.sh
# or manually run
locust -f locust.py --host http://localhost:8080 --users 5000 --spawn-rate 20
```

You will see a dashboard like this:

## üìÅ Public

This folder contains all the public assets for the web server to
*"serve"*.

## ü•º Experimentations

This folder contains some internal tests to try out how to work
from scratch with sockets and make a web server from *zero (0)*.
